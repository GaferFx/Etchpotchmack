## **Good health, friends, it's finally happened!**

The second chapter is already waiting for you at the open doors and is eager to check who dares to fight back against the invasion of nether into the world and center the whole course of events around themselves!

It seems that the time has come to open a new era and come face to face with exciting and disturbing news from the outside.

**All you need is [to download our custom launcher](https://files.foxhustle.xyz/FoxHustle.exe ) and make all opponents tremble!**

Well, or go explore the land and build your own settlements.

**Yes, now you can fully survive and embody all your wildest or most wonderful ideas in stone and wood!**

Who knows, maybe one day they will become a part of this era..)

## Here's what you'll need to know if you run into problems:  

1) **You definitely need to allocate from 5 to 10 GB of RAM**, this is done as follows:

- Start the launcher first

- Then click on FoxHustleEvent and on the settings icon in the upper right corner

- Next, set from 5 to 10 GB of RAM and click save

- That's all, now you can safely press the play button!  
**We are waiting for you on the server!**

2) **If you have a weak machine or the shaders are incompatible with your configuration, then you need to turn off the shaders themselves and send a description of what happened to our technical specialist in telegram** **@mak4ic**  
(sometimes it happens that fps tends to 5-10 with shaders, and 200 without them, but we are already working on correcting this rare incompatibility)

- **When entering the game, first of all press O on the keyboard**
- **In the shader settings menu that opens, click on "Enabled", so the button will switch to the "Off" state**

- **That's it, now you can click on the "Done" button in the lower right corner of the screen and enjoy higher FPS!**

3) **If FPS is still not enough, then you can go to graphics settings, to do this, press Esc - Settings - Graphics Settings**

![](https://img1.teletype.in/files/8e/d2/8ed29a44-44c3-4cb4-83e6-ce5e254825c0.png)

- Next, go to the "Main" tab and reduce the amount of drawing, shadow range and simulation to 5 (you can lower the drawing and shadow range to the limit if necessary)

- Next, go to the "Quality" section and set the settings as in the screenshot below

![](https://img2.teletype.in/files/19/a4/19a4fd57-bc67-49ab-8e7e-b9414635cc4b.png)

- **You can change the rest of the settings for yourself, but first check out the Embeddium mod**

4) **If the foliage of the trees is not displayed correctly as in the screenshot below**

![](https://img4.teletype.in/files/31/13/31130948-eb91-4585-90d4-e4a1069174a0.png)

- **Then go to Esc - Settings - Graphics Settings and in the "Quality" section set the Leaves parameter to "Volumetric"**
